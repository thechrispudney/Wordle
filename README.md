# WORDLE
A text-based version of the popular word game, built in Python
## Features
- Can you guess the five-letter word in six or fewer tries?
- A white letter is not in the word, an orange letter is in the word but not in the correct position, and a green letter is in the word in the correct position
- Unlike the official Wordle game, this version randomly selects a word from a pool of over 2,000... so impossible to cheat!
- The minimalist design lets you only see the information that's useful; no pesky user inputs showing between guesses
- Auto-save means you can leave and come back to a game precisely where you left off, and also ensures you'll never get the same word twice
- The game keeps track of your record: how many words you've guessed and how many tries they took you
